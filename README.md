## About the project
 
 This is not the official repo for this project!
 
 I refer you to [The official wordpress plugin page](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/marketo-connector-public) for up to date releases and official support.
 
 I was the developer of the proprietary version of this plugin for all releases before v0.8. A tiny part of it was recently open sourced and I decided to clone and branch the project so I can release (maybe pull request?) updates in the remote chance I want to use it or make my own tweaks to it in the future.
